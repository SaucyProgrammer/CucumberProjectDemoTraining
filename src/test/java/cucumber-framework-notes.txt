Cucumber framework overview:

Cucumber framework components:
- feature files -- documentation
- step definition classes -- test cases
- runner class -- classes that run the test cases, they are identical to xml in testng / are used to config running tests

Basic work flow of cucumber framework:
 - create a feature file
 -- add scenario/s to the feature file
 --- generate snippet/s for steps class
       -- create a steps definition class for the features you want to run
 ----- create a runner class to configure running your tests
